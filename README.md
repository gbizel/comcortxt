# ComCorTxt

This project comprises two main components:

1. **Training a Classification Model**: This component involves training a classification model aiming to predict one categorical feature based on free text input.
2. **Unsupervised Clustering and Visualization**: This component runs an unsupervised model to identify and visualize clusters within the dataset, providing insights into the inherent structure and patterns of the data.
